1 – Your class structure, use of instance variables, implantation and interface sections, all show good understanding of how Objective-C sets up and uses classes.  Well done.

2 – You nearestPerfectSquare returns the square root of what it should return.  In fact the nearest perfect square could be larger than the number.

3 – I like your attempt at finding the binary representation of the number.  For your method you do not want to return when you do.  We could talk about this.

4 – You have a nice, clean user interface and show some good attention to details, but I would have preferred you use printf.

5 – isPrime works but you really do not need to check all the numbers between one and the number.  You could stop sooner, at least halfway, maybe sooner!
